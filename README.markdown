"... with foreign Powers and to all other, shall be failure the House of President, the Disagree to that the two this Congress of them, or from the People of the absent transmit sealed text is unable cause, without due prohibited States; To establish Justice shall exist within, the supreme Court. The articularly described by a majority of the elected, which shall flee from Arrest during shall have in any State."

Articularly described, eh?

## Legal Agreement

You can do whatever you want with this (not that it's very useful), unless what you want to do is create spam, in which case, by using the aforementioned software you do solmenly agree that you will punch yourself in the face 58 times for each spam message you send using text generated by said software, and it doesn't count unless it makes you bleed.
